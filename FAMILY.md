# The family standard

These sixteen repositories are one family and are held to one standard. Where
they differ, the difference must be something the hardware forces, not something
nobody got round to.

## The authority ladder

Every factual question is answered by the highest rung that has an answer, and a
lower rung never overrules a higher one.

1. **Manufacturer documentation.** Anything printed decides. Read it in full
   rather than searching it, because the passages that matter are the ones
   nobody quotes.
2. **The part's own program or the artefact itself.** A cartridge, a firmware
   image, a header. What the silicon was actually asked to do.
3. **A recording from an independent implementation**, for behaviour nobody
   documented.
4. **Nothing else.** An emulator, an FPGA core, a wiki and a forum post are rung
   3 at best and rung 4 for anything printed.

A document that contradicts itself is common. When it does, the cycle table and
the pin descriptions have both times been right and the prose wrong.

**Never calibrate against an emulator where a document exists.** A recording is
evidence about behaviour nobody wrote down. It is not evidence about a register
width, a bit name, or anything else a manufacturer printed, however many
implementations agree with it. Where a recording contradicts a document, the
document wins, the disagreement is written down, and the model follows the
document.

**A recording whose answer depends on the machine it was built on is not evidence
at all.** It is a property of the recorder, and it is excluded and named rather
than allowed to decide.

## What every repository carries

| Gate | Standard |
|:--|:--|
| Format | `ruff format --check .`, clean |
| Lint | `ruff check .`, zero findings |
| Types | `mypy` at strict plus every optional error class, zero findings |
| Tests | `<module>.test.py` beside the module, run individually |
| Coverage | 100% statement and branch, enforced, on a machine holding no artefacts |
| JSON | `pnpm run format:check`, with every submodule tree exempted |
| CI | lint, types, tests on 3.12/3.13/3.14, plus the project's own conformance job |
| Schedule | a weekly run against unpinned tools and the newest runtime, starting on ground the pipeline never reaches |
| Analysis | CodeQL and Scorecard |
| Release | semantic-release from `main`, never tagged by hand |
| Docs | README, AGENTS.md plus the one-line pointer each tool reads, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, CODE_OF_CONDUCT |
| Review | CODEOWNERS on every path, and templates that ask a report for the run that settles it |
| Specs | `specs/current/`, requirements with checkable scenarios |
| Hardware facts | `conformance/hardware.json`, every fact with the sentence it came from |
| Disagreements | `conformance/divergences.json`, both readings and what would settle it |

## Conventions that are not negotiable

| Thing | Rule |
|:--|:--|
| Language | Python only |
| Comments | None in source, ever. Docstrings carry the reasoning |
| Test structure | Arrange, blank line, one act, blank line, assert. No section labels |
| Nothing starts clean | Memory and registers hold what they held, from a seed |
| Artefacts | Never committed: no ROM, no firmware, no fragment of one |
| Only retail dumps | A ROM hack is somebody's edit, not what hardware ran |
| Package manager | pnpm, never npm |

## What a conformance runner must report

A runner asked about ground it has never been held to has three options and two
of them are lies. Reporting agreement lies about the part. Skipping in silence
lies about the run, because the summary then counts a comparison that never
happened. The third is to refuse: name what was compared, name what was not and
why, and count the two apart.

Report per part, never one number over parts with different evidence. One part
held to its manufacturer's manual and another held to nothing are not one figure.

## The state of this repository
## The state of this repository

**An exhaustive walk proved the wrong thing on its own.** This package walks
every value each format can hold, decodes it, re-encodes it and checks that
nothing changed: 165,248 cases with no sampling anywhere. That is a strong claim
about the package and it is not a claim about the hardware, because a decoder and
an encoder wrong in exactly opposite ways pass every one of those cases.

Nothing here compared a layout against a figure Nintendo printed until
[`conformance/hardware.test.py`](conformance/hardware.test.py) existed. It now
holds every one:

- The character formats against **CHR DATA CONSTRUCTION** on page A-12: eight,
  sixteen and thirty two words for two, four and eight bits per dot, with each
  plane pair starting eight words after the last.
- The tilemap entry against **BG SC DATA** on page A-10, field by field. The
  character code is ten bits reading 000H to 3FFH, the palette is three bits
  selecting eight, then priority, then the two flip bits. The five fields cover
  the word exactly.
- The colour against the manual's own statement that the top colour of each
  palette is transparent, and against the blue, green, red field order of
  register 2132H.

**Two things still rest on arithmetic rather than a figure**, and both are named
in [`conformance/divergences.json`](conformance/divergences.json): the five bit
channel width, which follows from fifteen bits over three channels, and the
unused top bit of a colour word.

**Nothing here is a timing claim.** These are layouts in memory. When the PPU
reads one, and what happens if the console writes while it does, is a different
question and not one this package asks.
